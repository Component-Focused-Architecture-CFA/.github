# Welcome to CFA!

This is a front-end architecture I designed to keep React and Next.js projects scalable, readable, and easy to work with. It helps organize files in a way that makes development smoother and maintenance simpler. While it's mainly designed for React and Next.js, you can tweak it to fit your own projects however you like.

## Why I made this
I wanted a structure that actually makes sense for the way I build projects. Most existing architectures felt either too rigid or overcomplicated, forcing patterns that don’t really fit. So instead of trying to force my work into someone else’s system, I decided to create my own—one that keeps things clear, scalable, and easy to work with.

This documentation is my way of putting everything into one place, both for myself and for anyone who might find it useful. It’s not about following rules just for the sake of it—it’s about making development feel natural and efficient.

Full documentation is on the way! I’ll break down how everything fits together and why it works the way it does.
